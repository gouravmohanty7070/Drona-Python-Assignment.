### Overview 
---
Welcome to the Drona Python Assignment! This repository contains two Python applications demonstrating basic concepts in Python programming – a simulated drone movement system and TCP socket communication. The drone movement system is graphically represented using Python's Turtle module, and the TCP socket communication showcases simple message exchange between a sender and a receiver.

### Installation:
---

#### Local Setup

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/gouravmohanty7070/Drona-Python-Assignment.
```
No external dependencies are required as the project uses standard Python libraries.



### Project Structure

<ol>
  <li> 'Q1.py' : Contains the code for the simulated drone movement system using the Turtle module. </li>
  <li> 'Q2.py': Implements TCP socket communication, encompassing both sender and receiver functionalities. </li>
  <li> 'requirements.txt' : Lists all the dependencies for the project (Note: This project does not require any external libraries). </li>
  <li> 'README.md' : Provides project information and guidance. </li>
</ol>


### Usage
---

## Simulated Drone Movement System

Run Q1.py to start the drone simulation. Use keyboard keys (W, A, S, D) to control the drone's movement – forward, left, backward, and right.

## TCP Socket Communication

Execute Q2.py to initiate the TCP socket communication. The script runs both the sender and receiver. The receiver starts first, and upon pressing Enter, the sender sends a predefined message.
